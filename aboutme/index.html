    <h2>Jorge A. Castro Sedano</h2>
    <h2>Aka George :)</h2>
    <p>Hello everybody, my name is Jorge, but becasue George means the same I got used to be called like that when speaking english. </p>
    <p>I live in Peru, had the privilege to serve as a full time misisonary and learned most of my english in the mission field by practicing with my companions (that explains my grammar, lol). </p>
    <p>My major is in Business Management but I had a new interest into the dev field so I am looking to complement it.</p>
    <p>I worked as a cook for several years but now I am working in a friend's company that is more into tech, As a result had to learn new skills and I am now looking to keep lerning programming and web development</p>
    <p>It is a privilege and a pleasure to learn with and from you all. Thanks for the time reading this.</p>
